Description:
The project I created is similar to the popular gameshow, wheel of fortune. It includes the word solving of the gameshow, as well as the spinning wheel. Additionally, the player plays against a smart AI computer player
that uses frequency counting and training. Players attempt to guess letters in an unknown word. Correct letter guesses are shown in the board, and the scores also reflect the wheel and the correct guesses. Players win
by guessing the word correctly, and the computer wins by guessing the word correctly first.

To run the file, the user must first download cmu graphics package. Then, download the zip file with all parts and save. Finally, run the game.py file to play!

No libraries were used besides cmu graphics

Have fun!!
